# Password-Generator

## Description

The homework for this week was to create a password based on a series of prompts. We were given starter code.

## Criteria

* Must be between 8 and 128 characters long
### Must choose at least 1 of the character options:
* numbers
* lower case letter
* upper case letter
*  special character

The password will be generated and displayed in the box when you answer the prompts.

## Problems 

If the user presses cancel on confirmations, a password will be generated regardless of the user's preference. Unfortunately, this is a problem that must be addressed.
